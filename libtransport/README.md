Implementation of transport library to talk to all things ORCA and GENI.

Key classes and interfaces are
  * SliceTransportAPIv1 (API to talk to ORCA to manage slices)
  * IGENICHAPIv1 (API to talk to GENI SA and MA)
  * IActorRegistryAPIv1 (API to talk to actor registry)
  * IConverterAPIv1 (API to talk to NDL converter)
There is a factory interface  to generate instances of these for different transport types: ITransportProxyFactory 

The following implementations of transport are available, each including implementations of interfaces, include the proxy factory:

 * XMLRPC 

Other key classes interfaces are 
 * TransportContext - an abstract class that defines authentication context for connecting by a specific transport (e.g. SSL cert), different transports can implement different ways of creating a context.
   * SSLTransportContext is a child abstract class with PEMTransportContext and JKSTransportContext as two concrete implementations
 * SliceAccessContext - generic class that uses different type AccessToken's to support access to slice elements
   * SSHAccessToken implements AccessToken 
   
Examples are contained in unit tests under src/test/*
